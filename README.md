# Cullendula
Small program to pick out the best shots of the vast amount of taken pictures per session (excusrion).
The name itself is a wordplay of the plant Calendula and the activity "to cull" (slang for sorting the photos).


# How to use?
Start it and then drag&drop a folder with the pictures or an example picture to the central area of the app. Cullendula figures out itself which path to use.
It also creates automatically a new folder named "output" inside the given path.
The first picture of the files is loaded automatically too.
Switch between the images via the buttons at the botton of the app or use the arrow-keys (LEFT and RIGHT).
The button "save" (or UP arrow-key) moves the current image to the output-folder.
When you are done, then close the app. The result (the best photos) are inside the output-folder :)

This is version 0.1. First working release.
Currently just build and used with Linux, gcc and QtCreator 4.6. Some minor test-run has been done as well with Windows 7.

If you don't like - expand it or don't use :)
